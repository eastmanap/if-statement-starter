### Python If Statements

Take a minute or two to examine the Python code below.

```python
price = 59.99
if price >= 49.99:
  print('You can buy that tool for less at Home Depot!')
```

### Questions
Answer these questions about the code.  Be specific in your answers!

1. Using the code snippet shown above, what would the output be?

2. Change the item price to 39.50.  Now what would the output or look like?
It would be the same.


3. What do you notice about the code that immediately follows an if statement?  How is that code formatted or arranged?
It is placed beneath the if statement and tabbed.

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is even.")
else:
    print(number, "is odd.")
```

4. What does the `%` operator do in the conditional test shown above?

Seeing if 2 can fit into the inputed number an even amount of time.

5. How does the code determine if a number is even or odd?

Checking if the number is divisible by 2, if it is then it's even if not it's odd.
